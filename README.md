# Guesto
Guesto is a SQLite3 database access and visualization example in HTML realized with PHP.  
Its main purpose is organizing guest invitations. 

For visualization, jQuery https://www.datatables.net/ were employed. 
The whole page sits in a twitter bootstrap environment. 
Bootstrap's form elements and checkers along with custom regexps were used before adding a database entry.

####### Disclaimer

This is only a working example of database access and visualization. 
It does not follow the MVC design pattern for separating responsibilities. 
Be very careful for database access. Also consider implementing a prepare statement
